    "Malls are very important to our lives. They offer us a place to rest, eat, have fun and go shopping. The most crucial and difficult task for is to find the best location. It needs to be at the center of the busy crowds. In Kuala Lumpur there are countless shopping malls concentrated in the heart of the city hence it has become increasingly difficult for property developers to find suitable locations for their malls. So this project is focused on finding out the perfect location for building malls through the usage of data science. The data that i will be using will be mentioned in the next part.  "
